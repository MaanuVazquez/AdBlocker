# AdBlocker
AdBlocker is an app that makes your computer block all the ads from every browser or apps that you use. It does merge a HOSTS file from several verified sites (you can add your sites too) adding your old HOSTS settings and backuping the old HOSTS file in "HOSTS.bak". You can also whitelist or blacklist some domains depending on your interest.
